ML-Assignment-4: Classification Problem

📌 Objective

The goal of this assignment is to implement and compare various supervised learning classification algorithms using the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn. The aim is to preprocess the data, train multiple models, evaluate their performance, and determine the best classifier.

📊 Dataset

The Breast Cancer dataset is a well-known dataset for binary classification tasks. It contains features computed from digitized images of breast cancer tumors, categorized into malignant and benign.

⚙️ Steps Performed

1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing (✔️ 2 Marks)

Loaded the dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

Applied feature scaling to normalize the dataset.

2️⃣ Implemented Classification Models (✔️ 5 Marks)

Trained and evaluated the following classifiers:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Each model was trained on the dataset, and its performance was evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.

3️⃣ Model Comparison (✔️ 2 Marks)

Compared the accuracy of all classifiers.

Displayed results in a tabular format for easy comparison.

Identified the best-performing and worst-performing model.
